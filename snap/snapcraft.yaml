summary: A flexible event/agent & automation system with lots of bees 🐝
description: |
  Beehive is an event and agent system, which allows you to create your own
  agents that perform automated tasks triggered by events and filters.
  It is modular, flexible and really easy to extend for anyone. It has
  modules (we call them Hives), so it can interface with, talk to, or retrieve
  information from Twitter, Tumblr, Email, IRC, Jabber, RSS, Jenkins,
  Hue - to name just a few.
